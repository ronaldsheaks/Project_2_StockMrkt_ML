**IT SECTOR STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS FINDINGS**

THE STOCK MARKET DECLINED MID YEAR 2022. THIS COULD BE LINKED TO SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING INFLATION. 

POST PANDEMIC, BANKS RAISED THEIR INTEREST RATES, THERE WAS GEOPOLITICAL CONFLICT, SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS, MICROCHIP SHORTAGES, AND HOUSING MARKET INFLATION, CAUSING THE STOCK MARKET TO DECLINE BY 20%, 30% IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR, WHICH WAS THE HARDEST HIT ECONOMIC SECTOR. THIS CAUSED MANY IT STOCKS TO SPLIT. 

SOME OTHER POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE DECLINE IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR COULD BE A TECHNOLOGICAL DETACHMENT POST PANDEMIC, AS SOCIAL DISTANCING DIMINISHED. WHERE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ZOOM MEETINGS, PERFORMED WELL DURING THE PANDEMIC, THEY DECLINED POST PANDEMIC. 


ALSO, THERE SEEMS TO BE A YEARLY SPIKE IN STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE DURING THE TIME BETWEEN THE LAST AND FIRST WEEK OF EVERY YEAR FROM 2020 - 2024.
